# AlgoritmiApp
RecurrenceSolverApp is an Android application that allows users to solve and visualize common mathematical recurrences step by step. Users can input a recurrence equation, and the app computes and displays a detailed solution, including iterative expansion, pattern identification, summation expansion, and determination of asymptotic complexity.
